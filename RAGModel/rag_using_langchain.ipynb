So, I knocked the guard out, but I don\\'t want anyone to see what happens from this point on. And I\\'m very thankful that this prison security system has to work on Bluetooth. So, I enable my Bluetooth jammer while I put on my security guards outfit. How is this prison Bluetooth enabled? They thought it was very advanced tech about 15 years ago when they installed it. So, all the cameras have to go to these screens via Bluetooth. So, if I plug in the jammer right here, the cameras aren\\'t going to give any feed. Isn\\'t it obvious? He might be dumb, but I\\'m going to roll for him. He\\'s got a minus one.\\n\\nfor the day. The exit door that I\\'m miming right in front of. That exit door. Yep. I\\'m on my way. Okay. Okay, got it. I assume, as far as I know, my plan worked so seamlessly. I don\\'t know. I rolled a five. All right, in this regard, the scenario is as follows. You are wearing a security guard outfit that\\'s well fitting. A little tight in the groin, but well fitting. Um, in front of you are a number of other security guards and the warden at the front of the gate. And you can\\'t see the pepper spray trap behind him, so you\\'re just assuming he\\'s standing in front. So, your move is just to confidently be like, I\\'m a security guard. They all buy it. I\\'m going for it. Right. My shift ended. I\\'m clocking out. Not my fault. There\\'s a prison break. The guy\\'s back in the cell. The guy\\'s back in the sale. I\\'m clocking out. W. I I suggest you don\\'t talk. I just I\\'m going to throw that out to you. Just No, it\\'s worked so far. I believe. But you are using your fake security badges. You do have\\n\\nknow how I convinced the pepper spray not to go off. I give it the you can\\'t see me as I walk by. The prison break was not the archetype of this whole thing cuz the other one had like a very clear like if you get the thing, you also have to get out with the thing. But this one is just you have to get out. Oh, I we\\'re we\\'re not done. This isn\\'t it. There\\'s more steps to get out of a prison than get through the main gate of the prison block you\\'re trapped in. He\\'s outside. Bob, you don\\'t know. The pepper spray did not go off, but that\\'s weird. That\\'s a little weird. I\\'ll give you that much. It\\'s a little weird. It\\'s also still armed and behind you, so [\\xa0__\\xa0] Yeah. No, I\\'m gonna have to deal with that. All right. I\\'m standing inside the door. I mime my goodbyes to old what\\'s his face and I recognize his badge and I\\'m like huh did he shave and he walks out and then right as he gets past the pepper spray as the second gate closes and he started to walk away from up above from Wade\\'s cell I\\n\\nthis. I know where the hole in the wall comes out. It comes out on this level. Security. And there\\'ll be someone. There\\'s an alarm going off. I\\'m imagining he didn\\'t hit an alarm. He just shouted. I probably heard that cuz I\\'m right next to myself. I know where the security cameras on this level are. And maybe there\\'s a camera watching it, but I\\'m gonna blend in in real time. So, I climb out the hole and I club with my hands because I don\\'t have a club. The security guard in the back of the head to knock him out. So, everyone at home is listening. He\\'s got his hands together, you know, fingers interclocked and he went above his head and went, I\\'m going to club him straight down with his hands. You got minus one on your I guess it\\'s all just going to be 50/50. So, here we go. All right, here we go. You got 19 again. What? I I don\\'t know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Good thing I\\'ve been practicing my can\\'t hold my breath clubbing two hand technique. I I don\\'t know what\\'s going on. But yeah, total\\nQuestion: summarize the process of prison break in this video\\n')"

       " 'context': 'That\\'s a robbery in progress app. Okay. And I\\'m in prison trying to get out or what? Am I breaking into the prison to break someone out? That\\'s an interesting What would you rather do? Would you rather be breaking out? Cuz that might be more interesting. You\\'re trying to break out. He\\'s trying to keep you in. Let\\'s go. That That That\\'s actually better than trying to break someone else out. Okay. You have a lot of stuff for a prisoner. I sure do. And these are the only items I have. I can\\'t just Yep. You have You\\'re I mean, especially if you\\'re a prisoner, you got nothing. But I will say you can use the environment to your advantage. But it\\'s it\\'s barebones. This is Alcatraz level prison. Let\\'s just say it is Alcatraz. Hardest prison to break out of. It\\'s been done before, but it\\'s also in the middle of the ocean. And you have the world\\'s shortest breath. That\\'s a huge disadvantage. I love this for me. It\\'s time. I take a deep breath. Cough. Because I can\\'t hold my breath long enough\\n\\nyou have the world\\'s shortest breath. So I\\'m out the front door. Am I still like in a locked gated area? No, you\\'re out you\\'re out. I would say there\\'s another far gate like towards the dock or whatever there is, but that\\'s you\\'re in an open courtyard that\\'s almost all the way to the shore, but it wouldn\\'t matter if there are walls or not. It\\'s all ocean. There\\'s one dock at the end there that has boats where people come in and out of. Yeah. Having actually been to Alcatraz, I can tell you it\\'s a big hill that you have to go down. There\\'s like a big hill that kind of winds up cuz the prison is on top and the dock is way down at the water. So, you have to kind of like find your way down the hill and then there is only one actual dock. And weirdly, he has turned off all the power, which means there\\'s no lights, but I imagine there\\'s also there\\'s no power at the dock and there\\'s no Bluetooth. Wherever you go, no Bluetooth. Excellent. Um, I walk down I start making my way down the hill.\\n\\ncould do that. I see. I see. I see. I see. Bob, you as the security guard would be really funny with your items. All right, but also you guys, welcome to the No, this is the location. This these are where this is going to take place. There\\'s various things here. Some of them I was just typing because of alliteration or just I I don\\'t I don\\'t know. Anyway, here we\\'re going to be This is where the heist will take place. I remember Fort Rocks. Mhm. Prison Breakout. All right. So, this is the prison robbery or prison breakout. We\\'re going to rob the prison of a prisoner. Listen, if that\\'s what you want. All right. And now, welcome to the wheel of disadvantage. Oh boy. Oh, look at that. I\\'ve got about 30 something items here uh for various advantages. Disadvantages. Notice that this that\\'s pointed up directly at edging world record. Just just hold on. Okay. All right. Uh Bob, you were first last time, so you\\'re first again, I guess. Oh boy. Um, okay. All right. That\\'s interesting. Are\\n\\nknow how I convinced the pepper spray not to go off. I give it the you can\\'t see me as I walk by. The prison break was not the archetype of this whole thing cuz the other one had like a very clear like if you get the thing, you also have to get out with the thing. But this one is just you have to get out. Oh, I we\\'re we\\'re not done. This isn\\'t it.

The pepper spray did not go off, but that\\'s weird. That\\'s a little weird. I\\'ll give you that much. It\\'s a little weird. It\\'s also still armed and behind you, so [\\xa0__\\xa0] Yeah. No, I\\'m gonna have to deal with that. All right. I\\'m standing inside the door. I mime my goodbyes to old what\\'s his face and I recognize his badge and I\\'m like huh did he shave and he walks out and then right as he gets past the pepper spray as the second gate closes and he started to walk away from up above from Wade\\'s cell I\\n\\nup for the next round. Uh try to undo what they did, get ahead of what they did, and then see if you can fix this at all. I also didn\\'t think at all if there was like a have you even been detected situation. We can just like role play that in. All right, let\\'s just feel it out. Let\\'s see what happens. Do you have a wheel to determine which one of us has which role? Yeah, I\\'m going to flip a coin. Heads Bob, tails Wade for what does it mean? Heads I\\'m Wade. Tails you\\'re Bob. We\\'ll go We\\'ll go who\\'s the robber cuz they\\'re going to go first no matter what. All right, here we go. All right. All right. Heads. Bob\\'s robber. Tails. Wade. Tails. Wade. You are trying to break someone out of prison. So, to catch you up, Wade, you have the world\\'s shortest breath, a Bluetooth jammer, fake security badges, and a robbery in progress app. That\\'s not a prison break in progress app. That\\'s a robbery in progress app. Okay. And I\\'m in prison trying to get out or what? Am I breaking into the prison to\\n\\nthe chamber between the two doors that he has to go through to get out. I set it on the ground and I forget how quickly it activates. So I push the button to turn it on immediately. And then I\\'m sort of standing over it looking at it just like uh but I know even if I\\'m trapped here, he will also be trapped here if he comes to try and get out the exit. Uh I don\\'t know how to decide this one cuz I was like items are success no matter what. But are you trapped in there? I don\\'t know. Uh, I guess my my action is I decide I\\'m going to run for it and I make a break for the gate to get back onto the inside of the prison and see if I can leave that there. I hope it doesn\\'t hit you like in the tongue. That\\'d be gross. I guess because it has to point inward and you want to go back inward and it\\'s like a claymore level. I\\'ll say that you got a plus one on this. This will probably work. Yeah, you\\'re fine. You\\'re back in. Pepper spray is activated and you\\'re standing at the front the the entrance\\n\\nThis is a real tough role. But can I just say uh that\\'s not actually the main way to get down to the dock, generally speaking. Good. I\\'m just I\\'m realizing now. So, that lighthouse is sort of at the front of the prison, but to the right of this, cuz you see the dock is down to the right. Okay, the road actually leads to the right and then down away from the camera perspective on this. It does look a bit more foliageesque. So that that more of like a slopey side of the right side of the the rock there. That\\'s where the road goes down to the dock. So imagine I\\'m running to the right in this picture and down that it\\'s still basically a cliff for parts of it, but there\\'s there\\'s some steps in there or a ladder or vines to swing on. There\\'s a ladder diving face first down. He\\'s walking away with no one even aware other than me that he\\'s out of prison. So, I\\'m This is my This is my Hail Mary last ditch here. All right, I\\'m going to give you like a one in4 chance that that it gets you close.\\n\\nin any of this or I\\'ve had the longest time to plan for some reason because I like it as the warden. I just like to sit in my office and stare at all the camera feeds. I just have a big wall of camera feeds up in front of me and I\\'m just looking and none of them looks into Wade\\'s cell specifically. So I don\\'t think I see what he does, but I\\'m just I\\'m just watching and I\\'m watching and on Wade\\'s level on his wing, I think the security guard is like walking slowly doing like the rounds, right? So at some point here, I\\'m going to see the security guard walk past Wade\\'s cell and see that it\\'s empty and start to kind of be like, \"Hey, wait a minute. Open cell number one. This leads me to spring into action. All right. I\\'m going to say to you it it would all depend on where he is on his rounds to give him enough time. Now, Wade might have timed it so that that guard\\'s around, but I\\'ll say like that\\'s also a 50/50 shot of whether or not it\\'s this guard\\'s on the other side, so it might skip\\n\\nThat\\'s all I\\'ll say. He won the perception check. He sees you and he\\'s like that way. Which is probably obvious cuz the docks are that way. And you\\'re like, he\\'d probably go that way anyway. So that\\'s where he looked and that\\'s where he saw you. He doesn\\'t see what you\\'re carrying. He doesn\\'t see anything else. He\\'s just like, oh, I\\'m carrying a real heavy flotation device, which means it\\'s real buoyant. As the warden, I know that there are overgrown, but that they are there secret paths that lead directly from the prison exit down to the dock. And I see him over taking the main road. And I think to myself, I\\'m just going to I think it\\'s right here. I\\'m just going to throw myself down this hill. I think pretty sure that there\\'s some stone steps that lead right down to the dock and I\\'ll cut him off. I\\'m I\\'m 90% certain that they\\'re in there somewhere. And so I just sort of generally aim at where I think the step should be and I hope that by some miracle I basically fling myself down\\n\\nlike I hear that and I realize that the guard that just left must be prisoner number one. I dash through the first gate into like the chamber like the middle chamber thing and I have a thought and I go into like the security office and I pull the main breaker that turns off all the lights and it\\'s dark. plunge into darkness and then I do that mime thing where I\\'m all and I have an idea and I take out my glow-in-the-dark sunglasses and I go and get them going and put them on my face and I\\'ve got my glow-in-the-dark sunglasses now. That probably helped me see in the dark. And then I dash my out of the security office through the other gate and I just start chasing after Wade like a madman. How much of that do I need to roll for? How much do I get away with? All right. Me, I think that the sunglasses might help you with the pepper spray. Getting by the pepper spray cuz your eyes are protected. Was kind of a side thing I was hoping is they might deflect some of the pepper spray a little'}"
