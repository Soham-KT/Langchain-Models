the ai bubble didn’t pop with a bang,
it sighed like a startup pitch at 3 a.m.

hoodies promised minds in code,
“general intelligence—by q4,”
slides inflated faster than valuations,
models trained on hope, debt, and markdown.

then reality coughed.

gpu stacks hummed like space heaters,
burn rates sprinted, profits walked,
and the “revolution” asked for another round
because inference was… complicated.

it’s funny because nothing really broke—
the models still talk, still rhyme, still lie politely,
but the myth cracked:
magic turned back into engineering.

funny because the bubble wasn’t ai,
it was the belief that demos are destiny,
that scale replaces thought,
that “just add data” absolves design.

funny because after the pop,
what’s left actually works—
smaller models, quieter claims,
people reading error logs again.

the hype flew too close to the sun,
melted its pitch deck wings,
and landed exactly where it should have:
in reality,
wearing safety goggles,
finally doing the job.
